# gutt Quick Start

This is an alias for `/gutt-claude-code-plugin:setup`.

Run the full setup wizard to configure your gutt MCP server connection.

**What it does:**

1. Asks for your MCP endpoint URL (text input)
2. Optionally chains with existing statusline
3. Writes `.mcp.json` configuration
4. Tests the connection

**Usage:**

```
/gutt-claude-code-plugin:start
```

Or use the full command:

```
/gutt-claude-code-plugin:setup
```
